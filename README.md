## Numerical solution to the problem of a body of mass "m" on a table, with friction, attached to a hanging a body of mass "M" by a cord through a hole in the table.

**Description**

This was a project made for fun, in order to practice some coding.

It just aims to solve a simple physical problem of classical mechanics.

However I tried to be as rigorous as possible, even writting a little document about the whole ordeal.

In said document I explain all the process in detail. In this way, others can follow along and even find any mistakes more easily.
If this code is of any help to you, you find any mistakes (grammar or code wise) or you find a way to improve it, let me know!

**Note**:
The simulation results tend to be more accurate the smaller the value of the dt is.
However, proccessing time also tends to go up. A dt= 1 microsecond is recomended for a middle ground.
